                hear the music, I’m cocooned in a wonderful, loving feeling and I’m immediately relaxed. The peaceful
                feeling stays with me for hours and the more frequently I listen, the longer the peace remains.</q>

                about a thousand things, you remember the SOS technique, and access the power in yourself – in moments.
                The result: the world changes. This is new work for a new time.</q>
