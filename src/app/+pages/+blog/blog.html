        <p>Did you know that meditation is not just for relaxing or releasing tension – it’s been shown to actually be
            life-changing. It improves our mental abilities, strengthens our immune function, and helps us become more
            empathic. But many people find it difficult (if not impossible) to do — so they give up because of the usual
            complaints – a chatty mind, not enough time, or that it’s boring.</p>
        <p>I know this from personal experience. That’s why I was inspired to develop a new technique that could help
            <em>everyone</em> access that sweet spot of relief and inspiration. Why SOS is meditation
            <strong>reinvented</strong> – is that it works – <em>even if the mind isn’t still</em> – and, in only
            minutes.</p>
        <p>People who’ve never meditated or had difficulties meditating, report an ability to deeply relax, access
            clarity, and a newfound enthusiasm for life. The SOS Method is a comprehensive mindfulness technique that
            incorporates the latest scientific discoveries along with Eastern holistic knowledge that dates back two
            millennia.</p>
        <h2>How Meditation Reduces Stress and Illness</h2>
        <p>There are extensive bodies of knowledge in Japan, China, and India that have long recognized how stress
            develops blockage in our cells.&nbsp; When this stress is released or diminished, our body’s
            <em>natural </em>capacity for self-healing is restored.</p>
        <p>Similar to these widely recognized holistic traditions, mindfulness meditation has also been effective in
            providing stress relief and building resilience. In fact, <a
                    href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1809754">one large-scale
                review of 47 different studies</a> showed that meditation can also help with anxiety, depression, and
            pain.</p>

        <h2>How Meditation Diminishes Depression &amp; Anxiety</h2>
        <p>Many people carry a predisposition to anger, anxiety, or depression that’s due to generational stress. In
            other words, stress or trauma can be passed forward – causing an imbalance in a person’s body chemistry.</p>
        <p>This landmark science is known as Epigenetics, and it shows that changes in gene expression can actually be
            caused by influences other than the underlying DNA sequence. Previously, the DNA sequence was thought to be
            written in stone — a final determiner of an individual’s traits. But epigenetics has shown that
            environmental factors such as war, famine, and addiction can translate into symptoms that trigger the
            epigenome for generations.</p>
        <p>SOS Method activates the natural healing potential in the mind and body which helps to diminish the lasting
            effects of trauma, thereby alleviating these issues.</p>
        <h2>How Meditation Helps You Find Peace of Mind and Calm</h2>
        <p>Brain scans show that meditation shifts activity in the prefrontal cortex (behind the forehead) from the
            right hemisphere to the left. People who are left-prefrontal oriented have more enthusiasm, are more
            relaxed, and tend to be happier.</p>
        <p>96.5% of people report feeling more calm, relaxed and peaceful after only 5 minutes of listening to an SOS
            meditation. While it’s always nice to spend more time in the healing environment of deep relaxation – it’s
            helpful to know that in today’s busy world, there are techniques that can help us get there more
            rapidly.</p>

        <h2>How Meditation Increases Creativity</h2>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is a fascinating new area of science that proves our brain can change for the better.
            Essentially, neuroplasticity shows that neural patterns (previously thought to be fixed) can actually be
            altered, leading to changed behavior.</p>
        <p>In other words, we are not doomed to repeat the same negative patterns throughout life. These habits can
            change. The key to altering these neural pathways is through changed thought patterns.</p>
        <p>Chronic stress locks the brain into automatic response mode, causing the same unproductive actions year after
            year. Meditation influences our brain physiology; when neural connections are strengthened that support more
            positive thoughts and behavior – old patterns diminish. A consistent meditation practice helps develop
            greater mental focus, creativity, and the ability to access inspired solutions.</p>
        <h2>How Meditation Improves Relationships &amp; Self-Esteem</h2>
        <p>Hope breathes fresh air into all challenges, from the smallest issue to the largest crisis. It assists in
            releasing shame, blame, and anger.</p>
        <p>Another widely reported benefit from SOS Method is increased hope and optimism. This opens new doorways for
            more honest and heartfelt communication, which transforms our relationships, and help us approach life with
            a different perspective, more positive and hopeful.</p>
