            <blockquote><q>SOS Meditations brings me to such a level of calm. I have been in pain since my early
                20s, in excruciating pain because I have really bad fibromyalgia. And now it’s gone. I
                have been feeling no pain in my body for more than 3 years, which is a miracle in itself.</q>

                At the heart of SOS are audio recordings, which open the door for profound healing of
                mind, body, and spirit. These Meditations take you to a new level — quickly, easily, and
                without the trappings that other systems include.</q>

                I don't worry about peer pressure anymore. I've learned to heal resentment and anger because I'm more
                willing to. Very cool stuff!</q>
