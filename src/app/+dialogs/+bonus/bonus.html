            <p>There are millions of neurons in the brain, each producing its own electrical signals. These signals
                combined, generate brain waves. Human beings have 5 different types of these electric patterns. Each
                serves a purpose to help us cope with various situations – whether it is to process and learn new
                information or calm down after a stressful day.</p>
            <p>Binaural beats cause the brain to match the frequency of the binaural tone. This is what is known as the
                “frequency following response”. Similar to the theory of tuning forks.</p>
            <p>The frequencies used in the Relax and Deep Sleep meditations are either alpha, beta or theta to reduce
                hyperactivity and encourage our heart-rate, blood pressure and breathing to slow down. They promote
                pleasant states of mind that our body already recognizes. Be sure to listen on headphones to get the
                full effect.</p>

            <p>A native American grandfather was speaking to his grandson. “I feel as though I have two wolves fighting

                The boy asked, “Which wolf will win the fight grandfather?” “The one that I feed,” was the old man’s
                knowing reply.</p>
            <p>Our mind and body respond to what we feed them – whether it’s thoughts and emotions of fear, resentment
                and anxiety – or the opposite – positive experiences and feelings of hope, appreciation, and love.
                That’s why taking time to feed our mind and body is vital.</p>

            <p>Some tips to help you get started are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set aside special time where you won’t be interrupted</li>
                <li>Dedicate your brainpower to just one subject</li>
                <li>Shut out distractions - turn off cell phones and digital messaging</li>
                <li>Meditate, even for just 5 minutes, to clear the slate, and tap into your higher mind</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While this series was developed to boost our focus and creativity, the intention of all SOS Method
                programs is to increase mindful awareness.</p>
            <p>What this means is that sometimes we could be having a ‘breakthrough’ while others are experiencing
                ‘breakdowns’ or that sense of being ‘stuck’.</p>
            <p>If you are in one of those challenging times – use the Request & Envision Tool more frequently. New
                insights and solutions appear daily that support a wealth of new awareness, health and wellbeing.</p>
            <p>There is a natural flow that cannot be rushed. Learning to go with it, makes a world of difference. We
                are always growing and learning – and what we discover along the way, is always worth the wait.</p>
